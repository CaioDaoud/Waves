The majority of subscribers are between the ages of 40 64 and 58 are women People enroll in the program because they have been rejected for coverage by an insurance carrier or health plan due to a pre existing condition After 36 consecutive months in the program subscribers are required to leave MRMIP but they leave with a guarantee of coverage from plans selling coverage in the individual insurance market Services in the program are delivered through contracts with health insurance plans Californians qualifying for the program and for the guaranteed issue coverage that follows MRMIP coverage participate in the cost of their coverage by paying premiums The State of California supplements those premiums to cover the cost of care in MRMIP The State shares the cost of post MRMIP

Health Initiative Program C CHIP provides low cost health coverage to uninsured children through age 19 not eligible for HFP or Medi Cal up to 300 of the Federal Income Guidelines When approved by CMS the program will allow counties and other entities to use local funds as a match to draw down unused federal State Children s Health Insurance Program SCHIP funds The counties will use these funds to provide health insurance to additional children using their locally sponsored health plans The program is managed by MRMIB and administered the county C CHIP provides benefits similar to HFP but serves children between 250 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty level FPL Four pilot counties have implemented C CHIP and are waiting federal approval and another four counties are in the planning stages of their program This program is considered to be innovative in its manner of funding Usually federal funds require a State fund match before funds can be drawn down The C CHIP program when approved will allow counties to match available federal funds originally allocated to California but for which there was no State appropriated match These available federal funds along with county matched funds will provide needed services for children For further information call Janette Lopez at 916 327 6237 http www pacadvantage org Pacific Health Advantage The Health Insurance Plan

recent State Aid proposals and 2 a foundation formula approach with a mandated local effort requirement The foundation formula would set forth an amount to support the basic education of a pupil and a standard of local support in terms of a tax rate and calculates the amount of local support that each district would collect if it actually imposed this specified tax rate State Aid would provide the difference between the foundation amount and that which the school district would raise with this tax rate The Regents will deliberate in November and agree upon an approach to pursue A full proposal

instructions provided at the bottom of this page We have been honored to lead the Millennial Housing Commission during the past 17 months as we performed a thorough re examination of the federal role in meeting the nation s housing challenges at Congress request The 22 commissioners appointed to this task were drawn from across the country and from across the spectrum of housing ideologies and experience We are particularly pleased therefore to have achieved concurrence among all but one of the appointed members Click http www mhc gov rector doc here to obtain a copy of the Dissenting Statement to the Report of the Millennial Housing Commission by Commissioner Robert Rector The Commission included former elected officials participants on previous national commissions housing researchers builders managers and owners planners and public administrators and leaders of community development organizations Our findings and recommendations obviously reflect the great diversity of philosophy and experience represented but on one thing we all agree we unequivocally care about housing and some fundamental precepts First housing matters It represents the single largest expenditure for most American families and the single largest source of wealth for most homeowners The development of housing has a major impact on the national economy and the economic growth and health of regions and communities Housing is inextricably linked to access to jobs and healthy communities and the social behavior of the families who occupy it The failure to achieve adequate housing leads to significant societal costs Second there is simply not enough affordable housing The inadequacy of supply increases dramatically as one moves down the ladder of family earnings The challenge is most acute for rental housing in high cost areas and the most egregious problem is for the very poor We recognize that our country is engaged in a war that affects our vital interests and that we have experienced a serious economic downturn from which we are entering a tentative recovery There is a serious public debate as to which tax and spending policies will best support the sound fiscal management that our nation requires Even within this context resources for affordable housing provide important economic social and societal benefits The inexorable growth in the numbers of families of those working in service sectors and of immigrants seeking to take part in the American Dream coupled with community opposition to high density development the gentrification or abandonment and deterioration of an increasing percentage of our housing stock and the growing affordability gap between haves and have nots require that the Government of the United States seriously address the question of how our society can produce and preserve more housing for more American families in a more rational thoughtful and efficient way in the decade ahead As affordable housing production is increased within the context of healthy inclusive communities the economy is strengthened more families share common American values and economic opportunity is increased for many We are pleased to present the Millennial Housing Commission s recommendations which we hope will engage the elected officials of our democracy to meet these challenges  CLICK http www mhc gov MHCReport pdf HERE TO VIEW

2003 USTDA will build on the remarkable record achieved last year when the agency accelerated its program to provide a greater breadth and depth of service to U S companies foreign project sponsors and other U S Government agencies USTDA is known for responding rapidly to changing global environments In 2002 USTDA acted quickly to respond to infrastructure priorities and needs within Afghanistan and the other frontline states In these and other developing and middle income countries around the world USTDA strives to provide specific tailored and results oriented responses designed to lead to greater stability through capacity building commercial development and increased employment As a core priority USTDA facilitates development in emerging markets by promoting U S partnerships in high priority overseas projects Last year the cumulative dollar value of export sales associated with USTDA supported projects topped 19 billion although that number only tells part of the story Less directly quantifiable but no less important are the agency s advances in overseas development efforts This year also marks USTDA s first full year in our new headquarters Located just one half block from our old location the new office provides much needed additional space It also allows us to better serve U S businesses and foreign delegates on visits to the Washington D C area through our enlarged and improved Business Center and expanded USTDA resource library We hope that you will visit us at our new headquarters soon As President Bush recently said The work of development is much broader than development aid The vast majority of financing for development comes not from aid but from trade and domestic capital and foreign investment So to be serious about fighting poverty we must be serious about expanding trade USTDA looks forward to continuing to support this vision in 2003 New Press Releases trade press Dec05 03 html 12 05 03 USTDA PARTICIPATES IN INTERAGENCY VISIT TO

Early 2004 James E Rogan Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U S Patent and Trademark Office USPTO has announced that he intends to leave his post on January 9 2004 Under Rogan s direction the USPTO has improved in every aspect of its operations Early in his tenure Rogan who has headed the agency since December 2001 launched a five year 21st Century Strategic Plan that is revolutionizing the U S patent and trademark systems The House Commerce State Justice and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee report for USPTO s 2004 budget notes that this plan calls for some of the most sweeping changes to the patent review process in 200 years and the committee supports these recommendations During his two short years at the helm of the USPTO Rogan changed the culture of the agency by making quality not the time it takes to get a patent the hallmark of its work The USPTO now has an extensive program of quality based initiatives including new programs certifying that current and prospective patent examiners and managers as well patent attorneys and agents have the requisite knowledge skills and abilities to produce top quality examination results Rogan also established a comprehensive quality assurance program for patents and trademarks that mandates quality reviews throughout the examination process main homepagenews bak09dec2003 htm

Related Sites The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies NATT is a partnership working to address national technological challenges by focusing relevant industrial and research capabilities on specific transportation goals This partnership combines the strengths of national laboratories research universities the Boeing Company lightweight metal power to manufacturers with abundant low cost help meet its objectives The Alliance provides a format for these diverse innovative noncompetitive entities to develop solutions for a variety of projects NATT activities are co funded by the industrial participants and the U S Department of Energy s Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies The initial mission is to assist the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles PNGV a Presidential initiative in achieving its goals Our Mission PNGV PARTNERSHIP In 1993 the U S government teamed with the three major domestic automakers Chrysler Ford and General Motors in a partnership to develop technologies necessary to create the motor vehicle of the future The partnership aims to strengthen U S competitiveness by producing a mid sized vehicle with performance and price similar to today s cars but with triple the fuel efficiency greatly reduced emissions and 80 percent recyclability A key to achieving PNGV goals is to reduce the weight of the vehicle by 50 percent Weight reduction will be achieved primarily by using lightweight materials to replace current steel components A lighter vehicle will also enable use of more efficient propulsion systems PNGV faces several obstacles including a lack of low cost lightweight materials and effective manufacturing and joining technologies for these materials Once these obstacles are overcome PNGV will be better positioned to deliver significant environmental energy and economic benefits to the United States Fuel efficient vehicles will lessen our reliance on foreign oil supplies especially as our population continues to grow and more people use motor vehicle transportation Further the U S automobile manufacturing industry is integral to the nation s economy accounting for one in seven U S jobs Technological improvements of this kind will help position U S industry for world leadership WHAT IS NATT NATT is a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL initiative comprised of multiple regional industrial sectors brought together to improve U S industrial technologies Partners will focus on the research and formulation of advanced cost effective lightweight materials advanced manufacturing processes and prototype or pilot scale development The proposed NATT partnership will include the Boeing Company Northwest lightweight aluminum magnesium and titanium producers other automotive and aerospace suppliers regional electric suppliers such as the Bonneville Power Administration state universities the Big Three auto manufacturers and national laboratories WHY NATT The U S DOE Office of Transportation Technologies has recognized a unique opportunity to ally these Pacific Northwest components to address serious technological challenges Using cost shared government funds these noncompetitive entities can more efficiently work together toward a goal that benefits everyone OBJECTIVES NATT s principal focus is the development of technologies necessary to achieve the 50 percent weight reduction required to meet PNGV s objectives NATT partners will use their resources to design new lightweight metals shaping and connecting techniques and to lower material costs NATT will also work with the domestic transportation industry aerospace vehicular suppliers etc to develop technical tools required to enhance U S competitiveness and benefit a broad range of noncompetitive industrial sectors NATT will be a strategic U S asset addressing the multi disciplinary research and development that traditionally falls between fundamental university research and near term profit oriented industrial research Results of this work will ensure that the U S is a strong player in the world market UNIQUE POSITIONING The Pacific Northwest is well positioned through NATT to contribute to the national vehicle program PNGV The region s attributes include 40 percent of domestic aluminum production future cars will contain 50 percent more aluminum than today s cars Boeing the largest manufacturer of lightweight structures PNNL a broad based national laboratory having significant experience with the auto industry lightweight metals industry and Boeing Large low cost power providers State universities Magnesium and titanium production plants SUMMARY The Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technologies brings together Pacific Northwest entities to meet the considerable challenges facing PNGV The success of NATT s work will be important to the future of our national economy our environment and the Pacific Northwest region Powerpoint Presentation To view a Powerpoint

Top Within minutes of erupting on the crater floor of Pu u O o lava drains back into the East Pond Vent and causes vigorous lava spattering as high as 10 m The flow and drainback lasted only a few minutes Such activity is probably caused by rising bubbles of gas that lift lava to the surface The crust breaks allowing gas to escape vigorously and drive brief spattering or a low fountain When most of the gas has been lost lava drains back into the vent This activity is called gas pistoning For full sequence of images see http hvo wr usgs gov kilauea update archive 2003 Sep main html

development R D that will improve the technical societal and environmental benefits of hydropower and provide cost competitive technologies that enable the development of new and incremental hydropower capacity adding diversity to the nation s energy supply Program Organization and Management The Hydropower Program is organized under the DOE Office of Wind and Hydropower Technologies in Washington DC A concerted effort is made to coordinate DOE s research and development with that of other federal agencies and industry including both private and public entities involved with hydropower development An open peer review process involving industry and environmental resource agencies ensures that stakeholders are involved and that high priority research needs are being addressed A Technical Committee is maintained to review progress evaluate results and ensure coordination with related R D activities of other agencies and industry This Technical Committee consists of experts from the hydropower industry and state and Federal agencies In addition the reviews of specialists who are not members of the Technical Committee are obtained when appropriate Active coordination provides situational awareness avoids duplication of research efforts and creates a synergy among related research effects Three of DOE s National Laboratories with experience in hydropower issues provide technical support to the Program Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory INEEL Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL The lead laboratory for engineering and program management support in INEEL ORNL is the lead laboratory for environmental and computational support PNNL is involved in biological testing and technology development studies taking advantage of their experience with fish and test facilities A combination of industry universities and federal facilities conduct research activities for the Hydropower Program Where federal facilities have the equipment and personnel to reduce the overall cost to DOE they are used for conducting R D Updated Tuesday August 26 2003 For general inquiries

established the office in 1807 to encourage commerce and to support a growing economy in a safe and efficient manner Accurate reliable and up to date nautical chart information is more important today than at any time in the past As margins of safety narrow consequences loom greater as cargo capacities are pushed to the limit To meet this challenge more current and precise information is required New electronic navigation systems can meet the demands for greater protection of life property and the environment as well as significantly improve the efficiency of maritime commerce Today the Coast

For most of us getting to work getting to the doctor or getting to church means getting in our car But for many people it s not that easy there are often many challenges that individuals face when trying to get a ride It s not that we governments community organizations haven t tried to help Nearly every human service program recognizes that transportation is important In fact there are 62 federal programs that fund transportation services And we through our taxes and through our charitable contributions are spending a significant amount of money in order to help Ironically for most people who need transportation help the creation of more programs hasn t made getting around much easier We recognize that the key to using these services more efficiently is coordination The Department of Transportation with its partners at the Departments of Health and Human Services Labor and Education are launching United We Ride a new five part initiative to break down the barriers between programs and set the stage for local partnerships that generate common sense solutions and deliver A plus performance for everyone who needs transportation The United We Ride initiative will

gov toa Individualized Marketing Info html click here The Federal Transit Administration is undertaking a research demonstration program aimed at increasing public transit ridership with a minimal need for new capital investment all the while maintaining people s mobility Called Individualized Marketing the concept has proven successful in Europe and Australia and has shown promising results in Portland Oregon The FTA will be investing federal resources in a partnership with transit agencies in four competitively selected pilot communities in the U S The FTA s pilot project centers around personalized individual marketing of potential commuters who might consider using public transit but need more information Taking transit to the people has proven to be a unique method of boosting ridership without increased spending on infrastructure Utilizing a dialog based technique for promoting the use of public transport the program provides targeted personalized customized marketing tailored for individuals that are most likely to change their travel behavior The FTA will fund contractor support who will perform the Individualized Marketing Pilot in the four selected locations in close coordination and partnership with the transit agencies and local officials of the city area The primary model for this project is the UITP International Public Transportation Association project conducted in Europe The UITP project involved 45 transit agencies from over 15 countries The Switching to Public Transport experiment was very successful in demonstrating that effective individualized marketing can significantly increase the level of ridership bolstering the theory that a new customer consciousness has developed in which people view public transit more favorably and are leaning in the direction of considering transit as the single auto congestion continues to worsen Pilot projects in both Europe and Australia have yielded a reduction in car usage in the area targeted for the project of around 10 while large scale individualized marketing efforts 35 000 population yielded up to 14 reductions results tracked after one and two years A 1999 independent cost benefit analysis of the Perth Australia demonstration project yielded a 1 13 return on investment The first U S pilot project in Portland Oregon yielded a reduction in car travel of 8 in the area selected for the pilot and an increase in travel by environmentally friendly modes in the same area of 27 The one year evaluation of the pilot s success was begun in September 2003 and Portland officials have indicated that if the results hold firm they will consider replicating the process throughout the city Now the FTA is taking the project to four locations in the United States teaming with local transit authorities and local governments that will be selected on a competitive basis to be part of this promising pilot Each location will have unique characteristics to test the true potential of the individualized marketing concept The FTA anticipates that application criteria and procedures will be made available on our website and sent out to interested parties by mid November 2003 Completed applications expressions of interest will be due to the FTA by mid January 2004 http www fta dot gov office pubaffrs reducing car use pdf CLICK HERE for a background piece that will help

to continue your participation in and support of this important legislation As you know it is critical that we pass a six year reauthorization bill this year FTA Administrator Dorn Lauds President Bush for his Commitment to Federal Investment in Public Transportation FTA Administrator Dorn delivered good news to transit stakeholders on Monday February 3 2003 following President Bush s release of his proposed FY 2004 budget Dorn gathered nearly 100 transit advocates together to share specifics of the proposed FTA budget Among the highlights of her remarks Dorn commented that Although the Nation is facing enormous and expensive challenges including fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth the Administration proposes to sustain the record level of Federal investment in public transportation proposed by the President in FY 2003 She added that the FY 2004 budget exceeds the FY 2002 guaranteed funding level by 7 percent Dorn shared that the FY 2004 proposal offers the public transportation community transit operators transit suppliers and most importantly transit riders a budget that Promotes common sense transit solutions Encourages A performance Keeps our commitments

expand our understanding of subsurface contaminant fate and transport With more than fifty percent of the U S population depending on groundwater for their drinking water protecting aquifers from contamination is a national priority Responsibility for preventing surface and groundwater contamination is given to several federal agencies the Departments of Energy Interior and Agriculture the Environmental Protection Agency the Army Corps of Engineers among others as well as to state county and municipal agencies Because of a rapidly growing threat of aquifer contamination in our industrialized society each of these organizations needs dramatically improved technology to avert damage to our water supplies The INEEL s Subsurface Science Initiative SSI is a major research undertaking designed to help safeguard our precious groundwater supplies by applying science to a better understanding of subsurface processes and how they control the movement and degradation of contaminants in the subsurface over time The primary motivation for the Subsurface Science Initiative is to develop the scientific basis and new technology needed for the Department of Energy to remediate and monitor sites having radioactive and chemical contaminants in the ground as a result of research to develop weapons and peacetime uses of nuclear energy The SSI effort encompasses a broad range of scientific inquiry including geology geophysics hydrology biology chemistry and computational science to address nationwide environmental management issues A world class review board collaboration with governmental agencies working on groundwater problems and recommendations from the National Research Council guide the INEEL Program Our research focus includes development and validation of predictive models to guide programs aimed at preventing or remediating contamination robust waste contaminant systems to prevent contaminants from reaching groundwater supplies and reliable monitoring systems to provide early warning of problems before extensive damage is done We are developing new research capabilities and recruiting staff to advance subsurface investigations Multidisciplinary research teams are now conducting mesoscale experimental campaigns designed to mimic complex real world hydrological microbiological geochemical and geological subsurface processes Additionally we are planning a Subsurface Geosciences Laboratory user facility to enable experimental verification of predictive models testing of caps and barriers and development of new monitoring systems and sensors The Subsurface Science Initiative creates an exciting opportunity for scientists engineers and students to work in collaboration with INEEL personnel on cutting edge research into problems whose solutions are important for ensuring a clean safe environment for humanity and all life on earth Explore the opportunities and promises of the SSI through this web site Contacts P

[00]_688 # 	The Planetary Rings Node Neil Heather rings jupiter saturn uranus neptune ring planet The Planetary Rings Node is devoted to archiving and distributing scientific data sets relevant to planetary ring systems The two major classes of ring data are images and occultation profiles although a variety of additional data types e g spectra particle absorption signatures etc are also of interest A large fraction of our data sets are from the Voyager missions to the outer planets but Earth based and HST data sets are also represented The Rings Node also performs a variety of services to support research into these data sets These services include developing on line catalogs and information systems filling orders for data developing software tools and coordinating special observing campaigns The Planetary Rings Node supports research into all aspects of planetary ring systems including their physical properties particle sizes composition ring geometry dynamical processes including interactions with satellites and origins Indirectly the Node also supports studies of other dynamical analogs such as the solar nebula and the asteroid belt where similar physical processes are or were at work In addition to supporting research the Rings Node is committed to NASA s broader goal of educating the public about science and technology nodelogo html NODE LOGO http pds jpl nasa

water usgs gov pubs wri wri034091 Toxic Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley Toxic Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley br USGS Releases Study on Toxic Rainfall in San Joaquin Valley The toxic pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos were found in all rainfall samples collected by the U S Geological Survey USGS in the area of Modesto Calif during January and February 2001 storms The concentrations of these two insecticides in the rainfall samples exceeded proposed state guidelines for the protection of aquatic life in most samples by up to a factor of 10 for diazinon and up to a factor of 7 4 for chlorpyrifos Many pesticides become airborne during the application process and can drift off site said Michael Majewski a USGS scientist and expert in atmospheric deposition who contributed to the study After they are applied many pesticides volatilize into the lower atmosphere a process that can continue for days weeks or months after the application depending on the compound In addition pesticides can become airborne attached to wind blown dust Rainfall samples collected during the dormant spray season in Modesto and the surrounding agricultural areas exceeded the state guidelines for diazinon concentrations by an average factor of 5 7 for diazinon and 3 1 for chlorpyrifos Simultaneously storm runoff samples were collected from an urban storm drain where diazinon concentration exceeded the proposed state aquatic life guidelines by an average factor of 9 5 Sixty eight percent of the diazinon concentration found in the storm drain runoff could be accounted for by the concentration in the rainfall Additionally samples were collected from the San Joaquin Merced Stanislaus and Tuolumne rivers and Orestimba Creek during this study Sixty out of a total of 240 of these samples exceeded the proposed state guideline for diazinon and 18 for chlorpyrifos The highest concentrations of diazinon occurred in the San Joaquin River where concentrations exceeded the state guidelines by as much as 3 6 times The highest chlorpyrifos concentrations occurred at Orestimba Creek where samples exceeded the state guidelines by a factor of 3 4 It is important to recognize that the application of these pesticides affect all parts of the hydrologic cycle said the report s lead author USGS scientist Celia Zamora It is during rainfall events that these pesticides get washed out of the atmosphere and produce run off at surprisingly high levels that exceed the guidelines for protection of aquatic life The study will continue through 2004 at six sites in the San Joaquin River Basin and two additional sites in the Sacramento River Basin The complete results of the study will be forthcoming This study was funded by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to provide additional information to the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board for their development of Total Maximum Daily Load regulation for diazinon and chlorpyrifos in the San Joaquin Basin

got to do You do your work It was an opportunity to get out there and confront terrorism outside the United States FBI Criminal Experts Detail Scams FRAUD ALERT Don t be Grinched this holiday season The last thing anyone needs at this joyous and gift giving time of year is to be cheated by con artists of every stripe online offline and on the other end of your telephone That s why a sleighful of FBI Criminal Investigative experts got together today to outline some of the scams these modern day Grinches may try to pull on you and your loved ones and to offer tips on how you can protect yourselves from becoming victims of fraud this holiday season and throughout the year Nearly 2 500 FBI Agents around the country and around the world are working hard to prevent and catch these con artists said Grant Ashley who heads up the Bureau s Criminal Investigative Division Last year we investigated more than 20 000 fraud cases of all kinds insurance fraud telemarketing fraud securities fraud health care fraud and financial institution fraud Those investigations led to the recovery or restitution of more than 10 billion of fraudulently stolen funds Beware of scams like these Fake credit unions Con artists place ads in newspapers for non existent credit unions offering hassle free loans if you wire them a fee of 1 500 Or they have you fill out a loan application and then steal your personal information Debt or mortgage elimination offers The perpetrators of these schemes offer to take advantage of loopholes in the system that will eliminate your entire mortgage for an up front fee Don t believe it There are no loopholes Phony lotteries Scam artists will notify you that you ve won a lottery but you must send them some money to receive your winnings Sad fact there is no lottery and you never receive a prize Protect yourself  and report possible crimes If you come across anyone attempting these or other suspicious activities please report them to your local FBI office or police department A few simple precautions can help keep you from being Grinched  Never give personal information over the telephone mail or Internet unless you initiated the contact  Shred credit card receipts and old financial statements  Protect PIN numbers and passwords  Carry a minimum amount of identifying information  Do not wire money to strangers Fraud can happen anywhere said AD Ashley on the street at your front door on the telephone or on the computer The best thing individuals can do is be aware If a deal looks like it s too good to be true it probably is For more

location in the Catalog You can then scroll up and down to identify records corresponding to the source Obviously this option does not restrict the results to any particular source but does provide an efficient way to find the source in the Catalog browse listings html Locate Source 3 Access the Bibliography You can view the collection of journal articles from which the Catalog data were obtained

the reason many people work so hard to create and maintain a program such as CSLP There are obviously as many reasons as there are volunteers but I will give you one The ATSC and NASA volunteers who come to your schools are what you might call the second generation of space pioneers The first generation put humans into space and eventually on the Moon My generation concentrated on exploring Earth and near space but also on building the aerospace infrastructure But I think its going to be the third generation your generation which is going to have all the real fun  I believe you will put humans back on the Moon permanently You will complete and operate the first permanently occupied space station You will exploit the emerging technology to clean the air and water to feed 10 people where one can be fed now and to create medical breakthroughs which can only be dreamed of today You will also be the first generation which will routinely travel on transcontinental shuttles above the Earth s atmosphere And you will go to Mars and to Europa and perhaps even beyond You CSLP students have the unique opportunity to be the leaders in the inevitable technical and cultural evolution which will take shape over the next four decades So perhaps a little selfishly we do what we do because we understand how vital your leadership will be to the successful continuation of our own life s work So welcome please take full advantage of opportunities like today and above all have fun  An excerpt from Kevin Griffin s welcoming speech at the Spring 1997 CSLP student conference f ont Respond to the

to discover the wreckage of the Russian sailing ship Kad yak which sank in Alaskan waters in 1860 Working on his own time Dr Stevens used translations of old Russian documents to help him estimate the ship s position Using a magnetometer the divers located the wreckage in two days roughly 100 meters from its estimated position The Kad yak is historically significant because it is the only shipwreck from the Russian colonial period ever discovered in Alaska and also the oldest known shipwreck in Alaska http www afsc noaa gov refm reem Seabirds Default htm Seabird Fishery Interaction Research

objectives of the Meats Research Unit are to reduce the risk of foodborne illness associated with the consumption of red meat to respond to the research needs of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA to increase efficiency of lean meat production and to improve eating quality of meat Food safety research addresses the microbial status of the meat from slaughter to table using both molecular and standard microbiological techniques Unique methods are developed and validated for sampling carcasses and trim and for isolating and identifying pathogens that may be present Molecular techniques are used to track contamination to its source in order to discover additional hurdles that will decrease the transfer of pathogens to the carcass Factors that affect the survival and recovery of pathogens in stored and cooked meat products as well as on refrigerated beef carcasses are examined Special emphasis is placed on improving intervention strategies and developing new directed strategies designed to decrease pathogen contamination of red meat without adversely affecting meat quality All of the information acquired will be integrated into forms usable by the meat industry as part of HACCP plans Meat quality research is directed toward identifying key steps in the regulation of muscle protein breakdown during growth and during postmortem storage Special emphasis is placed on the identification of areas of the genome that regulate carcass composition and meat quality the development of methodologies to classify carcasses based on tenderness and lean meat yield the effect of breed on carcass composition and meat quality and the development of intervention technologies to optimize meat tenderness Current Projects Title Control of Pathogenic and Spoilage Bacteria on Red Meat Objectives Develop antimicrobial intervention strategies for slaughter processing and fabrication and determine intervention effects on microbial safety spoilage and ecology of the resulting products e g carcass subprimal trim ground beef Develop representative sampling procedures and sensitive accurate and rapid diagnostic methods to detect foodborne pathogens and other microbial contaminants Determine the effects of previous environment and or intervention procedures on the induction of adaptive responses in bacteria that result in increased antimicrobial resistance and or virulence Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms of pathogen resistance and virulence development and develop procedures to prevent these occurrences Title Develop On Line Verification and Intervention Procedures for HACCP in Slaughter Processing Systems Objectives Develop practical antimicrobial intervention strategies for slaughter processing and fabrication that maintain product quality Develop improved sampling detection and identification methods for monitoring and verification of Critical Control Points CCPs Determine and characterize molecular mechanisms and sources of pathogen virulence acquisition and develop procedures to prevent these occurrences Investigate genomic and virulence characteristics of pathogens and apply this information to the elimination of pathogens from the meat supply Title Strategies to optimize carcass yield and meat quality of red meat animals Objectives Evaluate effects of breeds of cattle swine and sheep representing diverse biological types on carcass composition and meat quality Identify quantitative trait loci QTL and genes for carcass composition and meat quality traits in cattle swine and sheep and utilize proteomics functional genomics tools to determine their mode of action Use biochemical and genomics tools to test the hypothesis that the calpain proteolytic system regulates muscle growth and development Evaluate the efficacy of various non invasive methods and develop new non invasive methods to predict meat quality Identify the relative contribution of connective tissue muscle shortening postmortem proteolysis and other physiological parameters to tenderness of various muscles and use this information to develop muscle specific intervention strategies to optimize meat tenderness Scientific Staff MRU WWW MRUSTAFF MK html Dr Mohammad Koohmaraie Research Leader MRU WWW MRUSTAFF TA html Dr Terry Arthur Microbiologist MRU WWW MRUSTAFF MICK html Dr Mick Bosilevac
